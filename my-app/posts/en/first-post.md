# Next.js Development Guide

Next.js is a full-stack React framework that provides many out-of-the-box features, enabling developers to quickly build high-performance web applications.

## Key Features

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Next.js supports server-side rendering, which means pages are pre-rendered on the server and then sent to the client. This helps with:
- Improved SEO performance
- Faster initial page load
- Better user experience

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
For content that doesn't change frequently, Next.js can generate static pages at build time, which provides:
- Optimal performance
- Reduced server load
- Improved caching efficiency

### 3. API Routes
Next.js allows you to create API endpoints within the same project, without needing a separate backend server.

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World' });
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Summary

Next.js is a powerful framework that simplifies the React application development process. Whether you're building simple static websites or complex web applications, Next.js provides the tools and features you need.

By learning and mastering Next.js, you'll be able to build modern web applications with excellent performance and user experience.
